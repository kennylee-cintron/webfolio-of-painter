                    <p>
                        A portrait in pastel is something between a drawing, as
                        it is rather loose and focuses on structure and
                        proportions, and an oil painting, as the underdrawing is
                        used as guidance for the block in. Both elements are
                        well visible in this drawing/ painting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This work was done in New York, where my spare time was
                        mainly used to learn to draw at Minerva's drawing
                        studio. Without Minerva, I can say I would still not
                        know how to paint.

                            <p>
                                Stephan is a classical realist artist from
                                Berlin. He specializes in oil portrait, but is
                                also skilled in still life and landscape
                                painting and likes to slip into the pastel
                                medium.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Now and then, he makes a sculpture. He has done
                                both private and corporate commissions. As his
                                second vocation as a psychotherapist suggests,
                                he enjoys working with people.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Stephan's style is a combination of classical
                                and direct painting methods. His paintings
                                express gratitude, joy and an exploration of the
                                issues one faces at different stages of life.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a new father, he has found his voice painting
                                portraits and images of flowers that intimately
                                convey the joys and struggles in his life.
