                        Sometimes it is an image and a story that triggers my
                        attention. This former street dog has made it to be not
                        just a family friend but also a guardian. She was
                        initially scared of any noice and partially incontinent,
                        but she managed to hush away a burglar. Here we can see
                        her sort of playing soccer with a shy sight.

                            <p>
                                Stephan is a classical realist artist from
                                Berlin. He specializes in oil portrait, but is
                                also skilled in still life and landscape
                                painting and likes to slip into the pastel
                                medium.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Now and then, he makes a sculpture. He has done
                                both private and corporate commissions. As his
                                second vocation as a psychotherapist suggests,
                                he enjoys working with people.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Stephan's style is a combination of classical
                                and direct painting methods. His paintings
                                express gratitude, joy and an exploration of the
                                issues one faces at different stages of life.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a new father, he has found his voice painting
                                portraits and images of flowers that intimately
                                convey the joys and struggles in his life.
