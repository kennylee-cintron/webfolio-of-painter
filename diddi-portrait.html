                    <h2>Dieter "Didi" Hallervorden</h2>
                    <p>
                        This portrait shows Mr. Hallervorden. When I was a
                        child, he was one of the few comedians we were allowed
                        to see, which was funny. When I found a newspaper
                        article with his portrait, I intuitively grabbed it and
                        took it to my palette.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It took three sessions to complete. From the first
                        sketch und underdrawing, to a more evolved block in with
                        more in-depth values to the final finish with details,
                        like hair and pupils. In between, weeks have passed for
                        the paint to dry.

                            <p>
                                Stephan is a classical realist artist from
                                Berlin. He specializes in oil portrait, but is
                                also skilled in still life and landscape
                                painting and likes to slip into the pastel
                                medium.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Now and then, he makes a sculpture. He has done
                                both private and corporate commissions. As his
                                second vocation as a psychotherapist suggests,
                                he enjoys working with people.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Stephan's style is a combination of classical
                                and direct painting methods. His paintings
                                express gratitude, joy and an exploration of the
                                issues one faces at different stages of life.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a new father, he has found his voice painting
                                portraits and images of flowers that intimately
                                convey the joys and struggles in his life.
